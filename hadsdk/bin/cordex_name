Rename files from the CMIP5 output file nameing conventions as output by CMOR
to the CORDEX filenameing conventions.

The meta-data attributes needed to make up the CORDEX file names are taken,
where possible, from the CORDEX NetCDF global attributes.  Where there isn't a
global NetCDF attribute (variable name, and time span) these are inferred from
the CMIP5/CMOR file name.
