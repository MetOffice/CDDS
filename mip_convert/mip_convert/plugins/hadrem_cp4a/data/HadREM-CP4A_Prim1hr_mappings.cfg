radiation_comment = For instantaneous outputs, this diagnostic represents an
	average over the radiation time step using the state of the atmosphere
	(T,q,clouds) from the first dynamics step within that interval. The time
	coordinate is the start of the radiation time step interval, so the value
	for t(N) is the average from t(N) to t(N+1).
