rld_rldcs = Physically, the radiation scheme used in this model ignores any
	atmosphere above the top of the model, and treats all solar emission as
	SW, implying that this field should be zero at the top of the model.
	However, when solving in the presence of scattering, rounding error leaves
	non-zero values, both positive and negative, of magnitude far too small to
	matter.
