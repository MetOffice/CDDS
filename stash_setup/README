* Tools to deal with stash setup for CMIP6 suites

Scripts are in bin, Python liraries in lib/python, configuration in
etc and data files in data.

* stash_setup
This sets up stash for a suite (and all the libraries belong to it
currently).  To set stash up for a CMIP6 suite you should say:

   stash_setup -c etc/cmip6-config.json

But addiitionally look at the READMEs in etc & data which should give
you some hints about what you might want to change (in particular the
spreadsheet version.)

* rsr
This roduces a JSON file saying which stash requests are enabled based
on a rose-app.conf and the atmos_dictionary.json written by
stash_setup.  It writes this to stdout: conventionally this output
should go into a files called .../app/um/atmos_enabled.json in the
suite being stashified.

* aer
This reads an atmos_enabled.json file and reports on the
enabled/disabled stash in a grep-friendly way.
