* CMIP6_datareq_UKESM_mappings.xlsx
This is the CMIP6 data request spreadsheet, with stash mappings.  This
comes by saving the google docs as an Excel file.  The Google docs
spreadsheet lives at
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ujq77lPMVA1EafHHxlYq8k_i7Xm9b5fSKJ2Nfo5GvPc.

The version in this directory is what stash_setup uses by default, and
has (probably) been approved by someone as the right version to use.
But you can use anpther version if you want.

* profiles.conf These are profiles (or, more generally, things which
aren't stash requests) which stash_setup adds to rose-app.conf.

* extras.conf
These are extra stash requests which are added.  This file is currently empty.

* extras-dictionary.json
This corresponds to extras.conf and its contents get added to
atmos_dictionary.json.  It's currently an empty JSON object.

* corequisite_stash.json
This is a JSON file which describes corequisite stash: it's an array
of arrays of strings, each of which contains a bunch of stash codes:
if any of these codes is requested on a given domain / time profile,
they all are.

* streq_template.conf
This is a template stash request: it's still used although it should
not be as there's no real reason to do it this way.
