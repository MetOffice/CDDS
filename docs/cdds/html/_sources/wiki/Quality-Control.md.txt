The Quality Control module is responsible for validating that produced `netCDF4` datasets are conformant with the WGCM CMIP standards. The largest part of these standards is the [CF Conventions](https://cfconventions.org/), but there are also some additional requirements more specific to the CMIP project. It is thus advisable for the user of CDDS to possess general knowledge of the expected data format.

The CDDS QC is built upon the [IOOS Compliance checker](https://github.com/ioos/compliance-checker) and uses additional plugins and a wrapper layer to override some standard features of the IOOS software and fix a few bugs related to CF-1.7 standards testing, and add new testing capabilities  CMIP6 requirements.

When running against a netCDF dataset, CDDS QC checks the following:

* The file names are consistent with their contents.
* All relevant global and variable attributes correspond to the CMIP6 Controlled Vocabularies and |MIP tables| and are present if required.
* There are no temporal gaps in the data, i.e. missing time records, and there are no files missing.
* The dataset conforms to the [CF-1.7 standard](https://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.7/cf-conventions.html).

The result of the QC run are stored in a report in the proc folder. Diagnostics that have been QCed and deemed valid are added to the `approved_variables_list` file, which is then used by the Transfer module to determine which variables can be submitted for publication.
