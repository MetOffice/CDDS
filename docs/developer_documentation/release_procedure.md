# Release Procedure

## Inform users of the upcoming change (if necessary)

!!! info
    Ask [Matthew Mizielinski](mailto:matthew.mizielinski@metoffice.gov.uk) if it is worth announcing the new version.

## Make the appropriate changes to the code

### CDDS Convert Suite (u-ak283)

If there have been [any changes](https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/trac/roses-u/diff?new_path=%2Fa%2Fk%2F2%2F8%2F3%2Ftags%2F1.1.1&old_path=%2Fa%2Fk%2F2%2F8%2F3%2Ftrunk&new_rev=121711&old_rev=126177) 
to the [CDDS Convert suite](https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/trac/roses-u/browser/a/k/2/8/3/) since the last tag, tag the CDDS Convert suite:

```bash
fcm copy --parents https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/svn/roses-u/a/k/2/8/3/cdds_release_<release_branch_version> https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/svn/roses-u/a/k/2/8/3/tags/<tag>
```

where `<tag>` is the CDDS version number, e.g. `1.0.1` and `<release_branch_version>` is major or minor version numbers, e.g. `1.0`.

If the suite release branch for this version does not yet exist, create a release branch from the trunk as follows:

```bash
fcm bc cdds_release_<release_branch_version> https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/svn/roses-u/a/k/2/8/3/trunk
```

### Changes in the CDDS Project

#### Branch from the appropriate release branch

```bash
git checkout <release_branch>
git checkout -b <ticket_number>_v<tag>_release
```

where `<release_branch>` is the name of the release branch. If an appropriate release branch doesn't exist, create one:

```bash
git checkout main
git checkout -b v<release_version>_release
```

where `<release_version>` is e.g. `1.0`.

#### Modify the CDDS code

- [x] Update the development tag in `cdds/cdds/__init__.py` and `mip_covert/mip_convert/__init__.py`
    ```bash
    _DEV = False
    ```
    Use following command to do that:
    ```bash
    sed -i "s/_DEV = True/_DEV = False/" */*/__init__.py
    ```
- [x] Update any version numbers of dependencies that need updating in `setup_env_for_cdds`
- [x] Build the documentation

!!! warning
    There is no release process defined for the new documentations. Please, speak with Jared and Matthew how to release the documentations.

- [x] If releasing a new minor version of CDDS, e.g. `2.1.0`, update the development environment name in `setup_env_for_devel` to point to the new version, e.g. `cdds-2.1_dev`.
- [x] Update the default CDDS Convert suite value in the conversion section of the request configuration
- [x] Ensure that:
    -  All changes  since the last release have been described in the relevant `CHANGES.rst` files. These should be added as a separate commit to allow 
       cherry picking onto main later
    - Any new files added since the last release that do not have a `.py` extension are included in `MANIFEST.in` and `setup.py`.
- [x] Create a pull request for the changes. After the pull request is approved, merge the changes into the release branch, **but do not squash merge them**. 
      This will allow you cherry-pick release notes from the release branch into main.

!!! warning
    After changing this version number, the setup script won't work until the new version has been installed centrally in the cdds account. 
    The installation process is documented at [CDDSInstallation2](https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/trac/cdds/wiki/CDDSInstallation2).

### Create a tag

#### Using command line

Only those that have admin permissions on the CDDS repository can create tags.

- [x] Switch to the branch you want to tag (normally, the release branch) and ***make sure you have pulled changes on github to your local branch â€“ 
      failure to do this can lead to installation errors that manifest as failure to build wheels***
- [x] Create the tag:
      ```bash
      git tag <tagname> -a
      ```
      The `<tagname>` normally is the release version, e.g. `v2.1.2`.
- [x] Push the tag to the branch:
      ```bash
      git push origin <tagname>
      ```
- [x] To show all tags and check if your tag is successfully created, run:
      ```bash
      git tag
      ```

#### Using GitHub

!!! info
    Github has a good documentation about release processes, see: [Managing releases - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository)

### Install the code

Follow the instructions provided in the [CDDS installation]()

### Ensure all the tests pass in the 'real live environment'

- [x] The test must be executed as `cdds` user
      ```bash
      export SRCDIR=$HOME/software/miniconda3/envs/cdds-X.Y.Z/lib/python3.8/site-packages/
      echo "# Executing tests for cdds:"
      pytest -s $SRCDIR/cdds --doctest-modules -m 'not slow and not integration and not rabbitMQ and not data_request'
      pytest -s $SRCDIR/cdds -m slow
      pytest -s $SRCDIR/cdds -m integration
      pytest -s $SRCDIR/cdds -m data_request
      echo "# Executing tests for mip_convert:"
      pytest -s $SRCDIR/mip_convert --doctest-modules -m 'not slow and and not mappings and not superslow'
      pytest -s $SRCDIR/mip_convert -m mappings
      pytest -s $SRCDIR/mip_convert -m slow
      ```
      where `X.Y.Z` is the version number of CDDS.
