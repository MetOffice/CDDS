*[CDDS]: Climate Data Dissemination System
*[CF convention]: CF convention
*[CMOR]: Climate Model Output Rewriter
*[Concatenation Tasks]: Concatenation Tasks are then run to join the files into a single file for a larger date range of length Concatenation Period. Concatenation Tasks are executed once per Concatenation Cycle.
*[Concatenation Cycle]: A concatenation cycle is a date range for which all data for that period is processed by one Concatenation Task.
*[Concatenation Period]: The length of the date range to be processed by 1 Concatenation Task.
*[CV]: Controlled Vocabulary. It is a pre-defined set of terms describing acceptable values for various quantities.
*[CREM]: Climate Research Experiment Management.
*[Data Request]: Information describing which MIP requested variables need to be produced for a given MIP-experiment combination. For CMIP6, see the CMIP6 Data Request.
*[Dataset]: A group of data containing some or all of the model output files from a single model simulation (i.e., model output files from a single realization of a single experiment from a single model).
*[experiment]: A defined set of forcing inputs, and duration, for a model run.
